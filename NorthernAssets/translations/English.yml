But over time, he grew in power, feeding off the malice of humankind during the long, dark winter nights. Now known as Krampus the Maleficent, he wanders the frost-bitten lands, seeking out those who harbor darkness in their hearts.

He is the last line of defense against those who would disturb the peace of the eternal frost."

He heralds the end of winter but carries with him the memories of bitter cold and darkness, a reminder of the season’s trials. It’s said that he roams the lands to ensure that all is left in balance before spring’s warmth returns."
runestone_deepnorth_1: "Niflheim The Tragedy"
runestone_deepnorth_text_1: "Niflheim, the realm of mist and shadow, ruled by Hel herself, is a place where the dead linger in eternal twilight. Those who find themselves here are the ones who wandered into the deep cold, never to return. Hel watches over them, her icy gaze a reminder of mortality’s fragility. She offers no mercy, only the silence of Niflheim’s dark tranquility, where the souls of the lost drift aimlessly like snowflakes in an endless storm."
runestone_deepnorth_2: "Hel’s Unyielding Gaze"
runestone_deepnorth_text_2: "In the heart of Niflheim stands Hel’s throne, a seat carved from ancient ice, adorned with relics of her fallen kin. Here, she watches over her realm with an unyielding gaze, a reminder that all must one day face her judgment. The dead tell no tales, but they say that her gaze is the last sight that the souls of the North behold before they are consumed by the mist."
runestone_deepnorth_3: "The Mistveil Boundary"
runestone_deepnorth_text_3: "Beyond the final peaks of the North lies the Mistveil Boundary, the threshold between life and death, warmth and ice. The boundary is hidden beneath thick layers of mist, where only those of the strongest will can pass unharmed. Tales warn that any mortal who ventures too far will be claimed by the mist, lost forever in the icy hold of Niflheim."
runestone_deepnorth_4: "The River Gjöll's Lament"
runestone_deepnorth_text_4: "The River Gjöll, a glacial current shimmering faintly in the eternal twilight, flows through the heart of Niflheim. Its waters are said to whisper the laments of those who dared defy their fate. Guarded by the spectral hound Garm, it serves as a passage for the dead, leading them deeper into Hel’s icy domain. The brave speak of bridges made of frost and despair, where every step tests the soul’s resolve before it vanishes into the mist."
runestone_deepnorth_5: "The Eternal Frost"
runestone_deepnorth_text_5: "The Eternal Frost, an ancient expanse of unyielding ice, lies at the edge of Niflheim, where even the dead fear to tread. Legends tell of forgotten gods and primordial forces locked within its glacial embrace, their power too great for mortal comprehension. The frost’s touch is said to drain the essence of any living thing, leaving only shadows of existence behind. To gaze into its depths is to glimpse the void itself."
